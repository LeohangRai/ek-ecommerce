# NOTE 1
There are 3 types of users:
- customers (who make orders, payments or add items to carts)
- vendors (who add products and their variants)
- admins (who create categories and brands data)

# NOTE 2
Unlik carts, the "orders" entity is for direct order of products.
"carts" entity is for user carts.

# NOTE 3
Many to many relationship between carts and product_variants has been resolved with a "carts_products" pivot table.
